# Lesson 1

TBD

# Lesson 2 - Characters

## Characters

### Furigana
- hiragana over the kanji
- will save your life
- manga commonly has furigana

### Katakana
- is boxier, sharp hangles
- foreign words

### Hiragana
- is curvy and flowy

### Kanji
- chinese characters — borrowed and adapted
- 15 thousands!
- you need to know 2000 characters to be literate in japanese (*joyoo kanji*) — regular use — thought in school
- 1000 should be enough when staying in japan

#### Kanji readings

Kanji has two different readings

- japanese reading
- chinese reading

depends if the kanji is by itself or compound

- itself > *kujomi*
- compound > *on* reading

(rule of thumb)

# Lesson 3 - Grammar

## Subject, Object, Verg

- English is a SVO language (subject verb object)

`I eat fruit`

- **Japanese is SOV language**

`I fruit eat`

## Tense

What is tense?

- past
- present
- future
 
In japanese there are **two tenses**:

- past
- non past

Japanese use the same tense for **present** and **future**

`watashi wa su-pa- ni ikimasu` 

私は　スーパー　に　行きます。

**ikimasu** 行きます *(verb)*: to go

`I will go to the supermarket` — is exactly same sentence

To make clear that is in the future, you can use something like **ashita** 明日(tomorrow), **raishuu**　らいしゅう (next week)

## Conjugation

- true for roman languages and english

`I go, he goes`

Japanese verbs **does not conjugate according to the subject**.

e.g.

(`ikimasu` 行きます verb) - to go

`watashi wa supaani ikimasu` - i go to the supermarket

`peeta wa supaani ikimasu` - peeter goes to the supermarket

Grammar is a lot easier for sure

## Singular and plural

- english we add s at the end, with loads of exceptions
- **japanese words don't make distinction** between singular and plural

e.g. 

- book/books: hon 本
- car/cars: kuruma　車

## Things unique in japanese grammar

### Formal and informal language

You usually learn japanese **formal** language.

### Concise

Japanese is a really concise language

The key to sound natural is leaving out things that are already understood from the context. **Don't repeat yourself**.
