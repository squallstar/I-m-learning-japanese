I'm following [JapanesePod101](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/learn-japanese-japanesepod101.com/id109573938?mt=2) podcast to help with me with studying Japanese.

Here below you will find my notes, organised per lesson.

# Writing system

## Characters

### Furigana
- hiragana over the kanji
- will save your life
- manga commonly has furigana

### Katakana
- is boxier, sharp hangles
- foreign words

### Hiragana
- is curvy and flowy

### Kanji
- chinese characters — borrowed and adapted
- 15 thousands!
- you need to know 2000 characters to be literate in japanese (*joyoo kanji*) — regular use — thought in school
- 1000 should be enough when staying in japan

#### Kanji readings

Kanji has two different readings

- japanese reading
- chinese reading

depends if the kanji is by itself or compound

- itself > *kun* reading
- compound > *on* reading

(rule of thumb)

# Grammar

## Subject, Object, Verb

- English is a SVO language (subject, verb, object)

`I eat fruit`

- **Japanese is SOV language** (subject, object, verb)

`I fruit eat`

## Tense

What is tense?

- past
- present
- future
 
In japanese there are **two tenses**:

- past
- non past

Japanese use the same tense for **present** and **future**

`watashi wa suupaa ni ikimasu` 

私は　スーパー　に　行きます。

**ikimasu** 行きます *(verb)*: to go

`I will go to the supermarket` — is exactly same sentence

To make clear that is in the future, you can use something like **ashita** 明日(tomorrow), **raishuu**　らいしゅう (next week)

## Conjugation

True for **roman languages** and **english**

`I go, he goes`

Japanese verbs **does not conjugate according to the subject**.

e.g.

(`ikimasu` 行きます verb) - to go

`watashi wa suupaa ni ikimasu` - I go to the supermarket

`peeta wa suupaa ni ikimasu` - Peter goes to the supermarket

Grammar is a lot easier for sure

## Singular and plural

- english we add s at the end, with loads of exceptions
- **japanese words don't make distinction** between singular and plural

e.g. 

- book/books: hon 本
- car/cars: kuruma　車

## Things unique in japanese grammar

### Formal and informal language

You usually learn japanese **formal** language.

### Concise

Japanese is a really concise language

The key to sound natural is leaving out things that are already understood from the context. **Don't repeat yourself**.

# Introduction

## Lesson 1 - Say Hello

`Konnichiwa`

こんにちわ

You can use it anytime, basic standard greeting.

`Ohayou gozaimasu`

おはようございます

**Good morning** (formal)

---

`Ohayou`

おはよう

---

`Konbanwa`

## Lesson 2 - Introducing yourself

### Example conversation:

Nicholas: `hajimemashite, nikorasu desu`

はじめまして、ニコラス　です

**nice to meet you, I'm Nicholas**

---

Kaori: `hajimemashite, kaori desu`

---

Nicholas: `yoroshiku onegaishimasu`

よろしく　おねがいします

**it's a pleasure to meet you**

We can't really translate it into english, literally: *I ask for your good favour*

---

Kaori: `yoroshiku onegaishimasu`
